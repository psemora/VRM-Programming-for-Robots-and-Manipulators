<p align="center"><b><h2>Sorting production line </h2></b></p>
This project is made in ABB Robot Studio simulation tool and contains two robots ABB IRB 1200. Main goal of the project was to create a simple sorting production line with two robots and conveyor belt. 

Due to errors in creation pack&go file, I inclose 
- viewer in .exe file
- rapid programs in .txt files - T_ROB1, T_ROB2
- config files (DI/DO, etc) in config.rar
- entire project in VRM_RS_project.rar
